# Co2 emmission prediction using linear regression 
The data set used for prediaction is FuelConsumption which contains columns like engine size,cylinders,fuel consumption and co2 emission.
we first import the libraries needed and plot scatter plots to find the column which is more linear with respect to co2 emission and further the data is split into train and test data and sklearn is used to find the cofficients for linear regression and we conclude by displaying the errors and R square value.
